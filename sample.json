            "Epstein was a financial genius, just not in the ways he wanted the public to believe. He was a master level manipulator who was also a master at making social connections. It wasn't just his personal funds, but the access he had to people who cumulatively had billions of dollars and politicians at the highest levels of power. Epstein could use his influence to recommend his friends to donate to a certain cause, park their millions in a certain bank, invest in a company, or do political favors for him and his friends. The banks that worked with him knew the horrible things he was up to, but turned the blind eye because he could bring them untold amounts of deposits. He'd take finders fees for these types of transactions. He'd also just take gifts or property at an extreme discount. His planes, and a few of his properties, were gifts from Les Wexner. Wexner signed over power of attorney privileges to Epstein, where he had complete control over his finances. \n\nHe also would donate to anyone who could potentially hold him accountable. Police forces, politicians, etc. He got away with all of these horrible things because he was too useful to everyone around him. He provided social connections to the most powerful people in the world, he could get you millions of dollars with a drop of a hat, he could exchange information to intelligence agencies or governments to prevent them from looking into his crimes, and he could hold that honeypot blackmail over the heads of those who participated and crossed him. He tried to legitimize himself like most awful wealthy people do, by donating tons of money to universities, charities, and donating to scientists to fund their research. Classic reputation laundering. This access also got him in the same rooms as these people, making him seem legitimate and doing a good deed. \n\nOne of his biggest schemes that's relatively untalked about [is the Towers Financial Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_Financial_Corporation), which was the largest ponzi scheme in history before Bernie Madoff was busted. He also got away from this scheme without any accountability, and his co-conspirator Steven Hoffenberg said he was stealing large amounts of that money for himself. [Hoffenberg characterized Epstein](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/12/how-the-only-known-photo-of-prince-andrew-and-the-pedophile-happened), \"You\u2019re talking about a sociopath who was only interested in advancing himself monetarily, and every component of his existence was at the destruction of other people. His only interest was how to use other people, their wealth, and their access, in order to advance himself. He destroyed everybody in his path.\" \n\nI think the trafficking element was primarily to feed his own sick addiction, as well as one more service he could provide to his clientele to help get him access to their money/power. Especially for the rich, awkward, dorks he hung out with, Epstein looked like a cool socialite playboy in their eyes. He also would help facilitate finding women to marry off to these rich weirdos too. The ultimate reward for some long term victims, would to be married off to a wealthy dude. Since they were groomed by Epstein as well, they're more likely to accept the same behavior from the person they're married to. Many victims also helped recruit other victims, in exchange for more money. You can see where this goes.\n\nTLDR : Epstein was an illicit finance genius.": [],
            "He was an influence peddler, a lot of very rich people's success and future success depends on their ability to either personally connect to other very rich people or have connections available for their children to connect to very rich people. A lot of ways very rich people do this is through exclusive private schools, exclusive social clubs, frats/secret societies, philanthropic events, political fundraisers, favor exchanges, ect.\n\nEpstein facilitated a lot of these, this was a very valuable service, if you're a millionaire movie producer and your son wants to get into politics, Epstein was a guy you could go to to trade a future favor for a current one. Epstein could get your kid straight out of college and into a mid tier position for someone in someone inportants campaign. Maybe next a musician will want to be in a movie to move his career forward, Epstein can call in a favor with a producer to get them in a movie in exchange for a later favor. Maybe someone will come to him later who needs a boost in campaign funding, Epstein can bankroll a fundraiser where he can invite several high dollar donors who want to be involved in politics and maybe a big name musical act to cap it off. \n\nSort of influence pedaling was a bridge for the wealthy who needed extra influence beyond their own circle. His plane was a great way to offer these people favors that he could exchange for different favors down the line. He isn't the only one who does this, it's fairly common, he's just the most famous one today because of his legal problems.\n\nThese kind of influence peddlers have been around since the aristocracies of Europe started to fall, most tried to maintain their position through investments from their estates and many gambled their fortunes away. Others used their entrenched connections with business to sell their influence with both business and the crown to maintain their estates, they had to do it or get a real job. Early intelligence activities relied on becoming friends with these people. They had access to people from the top of their government to local ship builders and munitions suppliers, their cousin might be 5th in line to the Crown. So as time went on and capitalism created a new upper class and connection to the crown became less useful other just merely rich people or influential people became just as useful. In World War II Abwehr agents were given hard cash and told to essentially go to parties with these rich influence traders so they can make these connections that would give them intelligence. \n\nAs one of these influence peddlers Epstein is a natural target for intelligence agencies. It makes sense that an agency would want to know what favors people are asking from him.": [],

I moved away from DC cuz I couldn't afford it anymore. But DC is also where most security clearance jobs are. Because that area's so expensive there's just gonna be less people living there who can qualify for a clearance. Thus, our fucked up economy is inherently a national security problem- we have a chronic shortage of qualified individuals who can work with classified information because so many people are struggling economically. Because of this shortage the US is overly reliant on people who get clearance through the military which is probably why we had that 19 year old idiot in the air guard spill secrets in a freaking discord server.

In return for Epstein providing this service the CIA provided Epstein with cover so he could commit his dirty deeds.\n\nKeep in mind, this is the same CIA that flooded our streets with cocaine so they could find their private war (that's a fact)\n\nBusiness 2: Epistein would get rich people in compromising positions in return he would black mail them and they'd give him money.\n\nKeep in mind Epstein accomplice Maxwell I believe her name was had ties to Isreali Intelligence which likely gave him ties to the CIA.\n\nAlso keep in mind intelligence isn't always done on our enemies, hence Prince Andrew, Prince Andrew being British Royalty likely had at least some exposure to the British govt and likely provided the CIA with intelligence. \n\nAlso I don't believe business 1 and 2 where \"exclusive\" of each other and you could absolutely have crossover.\n\nFinally this is why I knew Epstein would be dead before his trial ever truly got underway.": {},
