becoming friends with these people They had access to people from the top of their government to local ship builders and munitions suppliers their cousin might be 5th in line to the Crown So as time went on and capitalism created a new upper class and connection to the crown became less useful other just merely rich people or influential people became just as useful In World War II Abwehr agents
