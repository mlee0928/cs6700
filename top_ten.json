            "Epstein was a financial genius, just not in the ways he wanted the public to believe. He was a master level manipulator who was also a master at making social connections. It wasn't just his personal funds, but the access he had to people who cumulatively had billions of dollars and politicians at the highest levels of power. Epstein could use his influence to recommend his friends to donate to a certain cause, park their millions in a certain bank, invest in a company, or do political favors for him and his friends. The banks that worked with him knew the horrible things he was up to, but turned the blind eye because he could bring them untold amounts of deposits. He'd take finders fees for these types of transactions. He'd also just take gifts or property at an extreme discount. His planes, and a few of his properties, were gifts from Les Wexner. Wexner signed over power of attorney privileges to Epstein, where he had complete control over his finances. \n\nHe also would donate to anyone who could potentially hold him accountable. Police forces, politicians, etc. He got away with all of these horrible things because he was too useful to everyone around him. He provided social connections to the most powerful people in the world, he could get you millions of dollars with a drop of a hat, he could exchange information to intelligence agencies or governments to prevent them from looking into his crimes, and he could hold that honeypot blackmail over the heads of those who participated and crossed him. He tried to legitimize himself like most awful wealthy people do, by donating tons of money to universities, charities, and donating to scientists to fund their research. Classic reputation laundering. This access also got him in the same rooms as these people, making him seem legitimate and doing a good deed. \n\nOne of his biggest schemes that's relatively untalked about [is the Towers Financial Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_Financial_Corporation), which was the largest ponzi scheme in history before Bernie Madoff was busted. He also got away from this scheme without any accountability, and his co-conspirator Steven Hoffenberg said he was stealing large amounts of that money for himself. [Hoffenberg characterized Epstein](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/12/how-the-only-known-photo-of-prince-andrew-and-the-pedophile-happened), \"You\u2019re talking about a sociopath who was only interested in advancing himself monetarily, and every component of his existence was at the destruction of other people. His only interest was how to use other people, their wealth, and their access, in order to advance himself. He destroyed everybody in his path.\" \n\nI think the trafficking element was primarily to feed his own sick addiction, as well as one more service he could provide to his clientele to help get him access to their money/power. Especially for the rich, awkward, dorks he hung out with, Epstein looked like a cool socialite playboy in their eyes. He also would help facilitate finding women to marry off to these rich weirdos too. The ultimate reward for some long term victims, would to be married off to a wealthy dude. Since they were groomed by Epstein as well, they're more likely to accept the same behavior from the person they're married to. Many victims also helped recruit other victims, in exchange for more money. You can see where this goes.\n\nTLDR : Epstein was an illicit finance genius.": [],
            "He was an influence peddler, a lot of very rich people's success and future success depends on their ability to either personally connect to other very rich people or have connections available for their children to connect to very rich people. A lot of ways very rich people do this is through exclusive private schools, exclusive social clubs, frats/secret societies, philanthropic events, political fundraisers, favor exchanges, ect.\n\nEpstein facilitated a lot of these, this was a very valuable service, if you're a millionaire movie producer and your son wants to get into politics, Epstein was a guy you could go to to trade a future favor for a current one. Epstein could get your kid straight out of college and into a mid tier position for someone in someone inportants campaign. Maybe next a musician will want to be in a movie to move his career forward, Epstein can call in a favor with a producer to get them in a movie in exchange for a later favor. Maybe someone will come to him later who needs a boost in campaign funding, Epstein can bankroll a fundraiser where he can invite several high dollar donors who want to be involved in politics and maybe a big name musical act to cap it off. \n\nSort of influence pedaling was a bridge for the wealthy who needed extra influence beyond their own circle. His plane was a great way to offer these people favors that he could exchange for different favors down the line. He isn't the only one who does this, it's fairly common, he's just the most famous one today because of his legal problems.\n\nThese kind of influence peddlers have been around since the aristocracies of Europe started to fall, most tried to maintain their position through investments from their estates and many gambled their fortunes away. Others used their entrenched connections with business to sell their influence with both business and the crown to maintain their estates, they had to do it or get a real job. Early intelligence activities relied on becoming friends with these people. They had access to people from the top of their government to local ship builders and munitions suppliers, their cousin might be 5th in line to the Crown. So as time went on and capitalism created a new upper class and connection to the crown became less useful other just merely rich people or influential people became just as useful. In World War II Abwehr agents were given hard cash and told to essentially go to parties with these rich influence traders so they can make these connections that would give them intelligence. \n\nAs one of these influence peddlers Epstein is a natural target for intelligence agencies. It makes sense that an agency would want to know what favors people are asking from him.": [],

I moved away from DC cuz I couldn't afford it anymore. But DC is also where most security clearance jobs are. Because that area's so expensive there's just gonna be less people living there who can qualify for a clearance. Thus, our fucked up economy is inherently a national security problem- we have a chronic shortage of qualified individuals who can work with classified information because so many people are struggling economically. Because of this shortage the US is overly reliant on people who get clearance through the military which is probably why we had that 19 year old idiot in the air guard spill secrets in a freaking discord server.

                "If the paper linked above is the same as what OP posted about, then OP's title is misleading. The above article doesn't use a typical filtration system to remove PFOA, they used electrolysis to break down PFOA and other PFAS compounds.\n\nThey used a boron-doped diamond anode and stainless steel cathode in a bench top electrochemical cell (small-scale system) and varied a bunch of factors over 3 hr maximum.\n\nFrom the figures, it looks like a fair number of the conditions could fully degrade the concentration of PFOA they used in about an hour, though the authors noted later in the paper that using actual wastewater or natural water conditions decreased the efficiency of the system.\n\nIt sounds like electrode deposition and radicals produced during electrolysis, namely SO4\u2022- and \u2022OH (from a 0.1-1% sodium sulfate solution) contributed most to the degradation. Acidic conditions and temperature also played a role, though it looks like anything above room temp only provided marginal improvements in the time it took to degrade PFOA.\n\nAll of this sounds like it can be used as a step toward destroying PFAS, but sounds like it would have significant problems in scalability. Granted, water treatment is outside my field and my knowledge is limited here. The paper provides some understanding of the degradation pathways and some decent DoE on the conditions needed...at this scale.\n\nThere are useful things here, but from a practical standpoint, and notably as a chemist from a different field (so take this with a grain of salt), I doubt people will be installing anything based on this research in their home to filter out PFAS anytime soon.\n\nIf you want a copypasta of the SI methods from that paper, lmk and I'll drop them in another comment.\n\nEdit: To be clear, because I think my comment above sounds a bit pessimistic, I think they show some good progress in this paper. Finding a way to convert PFAS into less toxic or non-toxic compounds is great. I'm only saying that there is significant work to be done to scale this process up to a level that will functionally help remove PFAS from our water.\n\nThe phrasing of the post title and the NBC article are hyped (as usual), but the science is solid and a good step forward.

They're the gold standard in non-stick coatings and water repellents. Unfortunately, they're so good at what they do, they don't like to break down. \n\nThis method uses a specific resin filter that is acutely basic and anionic (read: very high pH and negatively charged). You'd push your pre-filtered, PFC-contaminated water through the resin. After the resin has been spent, you would wash it in a brine solution to remove the trapped PFC's and revive the resin for repeated use. They also tried a methanol: ammonium chloride rinse to eliminate water as a component of the resin rinse, but it wasn't as good\n\nTheir conclusion:\n>99% PFAS removal can be achieved for more than 150,000 BV in DI waters (PFAS C0 = 10 \u03bcg/L (individual concentrations)).\n\n>Regeneration with 10% NaCl with 2 h of contact time ensured an effective recovery of PFAS (>85%), DOC (>80%), sulphate (>90%), phosphate (>85%) and nitrate (>85%) ions from natural waters.\n\n>The highest PFOA decomposition rate was achieved by combining a high current density and stirrer speed, the two main operating parameters. Acidic condition, high temperature, and low initial concentration of PFOA accelerated the degradation kinetic, while DO had a negligible effect on the decomposition of PFOA.\n\nEdits: the original paper linked was from 2022 and specific on PFC filtering.

A few thoughts about this methodology \n\n* ~~As many noted, this isn't a destruction but removal. What you end up with is a concentrated PFAS waste stream that has to be disposed of which... is a huge problem given that PFAS, as mentioned above, are incredibly difficult to break down.~~\n\n* EPA is the process of developing enforceable standards in the form of a maximum contaminant level (MCL). Currently the [proposed level](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas) for some of these compounds is 4.0 ppt or 4 ng/l.  This is crazy low. I don't have full access to the paper but I'm curious to see at what concentrations this method could reduce. Essentially, if it's above 4.0 ppt then what's the point.\n\n* My final concern is scalability and cost. Are small [ground water systems](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/pfas-us-drinking-water-wells-study) going to be priced out of this treatment option? Can it be scaled to help larger systems? I'm not even talking about huge cities like NYC or LA but even mid sized cities like Denver have the capacity to up to [600 million gallons a day](https://www.denverwater.org/about-us/how-we-operate/key-facts) : can this tech be scaled without breaking the bank? \n\nI'm not trying to shit on this method, I just have concerns and really hope these concerns can be sorted out but as of now, there are some caveats.\n\nEDIT : the comment I responded to added [this link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653523000097) which discusses breaking down PFOA.

            "PFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1940s. They have been used to make nonstick cookware, water-repellent clothing, stain resistant fabrics and carpets, some cosmetics, some firefighting foams, and products that resist grease, water, and oil.\u00a0\nThe most commonly studied PFAS are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The next most commonly studied are perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). PFOA and PFOS have been phased out of production and use in the United States, but other countries may still manufacture and use them.\u00a0\nDuring production and use, PFAS can migrate into the soil, water, and air. Most PFAS (including PFOA and PFOS) do not break down, so they remain in the environment. Because of their widespread use and their persistence in the environment, PFAS are found in the blood of people and animals all over the world and are present at low levels in a variety of food products and in the environment. Some PFAS can build up in people and animals with repeated exposure over time.\u00a0\nMany scientific articles have been published about PFAS exposure and health effects. While it is difficult to show that substances directly cause health conditions in humans, scientific studies have shown that exposure to some PFAS in the environment may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. More research is needed to better understand the health effects of PFAS exposure.\u00a0\nNew kinds of PFAS are being developed. Some of these may have properties similar to the existing PFAS, and some may be less persistent in the environment. There are very few scientific studies on new PFAS, so more research is necessary to discover whether they may be a health concern.\u00a0\n\nELIA5: This new water filter removes these bioaccumulative compounds": []

Crushing the head to get at the brain, maybe, but I'm not familiar what kind of predators and scavengers live in the area he was found. Still I find it implausible as very few animals have the means or interrest to crack a skull as AFAIK the brain isn't that nutritious compared to f.ex. the liver or just plain muscle.\n\nGoogle-fuu gives me this breakdown of the nutritional value of a human brain:\n\n\"For every 100 grams of brain there are 78 grams of water, 10 grams of fat, 11 grams of protein, and 1 gram of carbohydrate, which equates to about 143 calories.\" Tho insects that can get in without having to crush the skull will happily eat it.\n\nI had trouble finding numbers for human muscles. Most sources not talking about building muscle give a ratio of about 100 grams = 180 calories or a little bit more (1KG = 1817 calories as the higest number given.)\n\nEdit: Apologies for my crass wording, I was using clinical terms and calling his corpse a carcass was not nice.

One spring break, me and a few friends decided to spend a couple of weeks driving around the country visiting chapters in as many states as we could. Amazing trip. \n\nOne of the friends on the trip was a big black guy named Josh. Funniest, quirkiest dude ever. One night in Mississippi, we were on a back road trying to find a bar where we were meeting some guys from a chapter down there. We were all stone sober, no alcohol or drugs in the car. \n\nSuddenly we get pulled over and this raggedy fucking cop gets out of his cruiser looking like Jim Lahey from TPB. He slooowly walks around our car (a WRX with NY plates, erp) shining his flashlight in the windows. He gets to Josh and his body language went stiff. He literally just stood there shining the flashlight on Josh for a few minutes while talking into his radio. He didn't talk to us or respond when we asked why we were pulled over. \n\nNext thing you know, what must have been the entire local police department comes flying to the scene, sirens wailing. Cops are milling around, peering into Josh's window with their flashlights. Josh is from Chicago so he's no stranger to shady cops, but he's sweating bullets and just muttering \"what the fuck man, what the fuck\" while we tried to reassure him that nothing would happen, there's nothing in the car, etc. Easy for us white kids to say!\n\nThey had us get out of the car and searched it. Josh - and only Josh - got pushed up against the car and roughly searched. Then they started asking us questions about where we were going etc etc etc. I got fed up, demanded to at least be told what we'd been pulled over for, and was told to \"shut the fuck up.\" \n\nThey kept us there for nearly an hour while they ripped the car and all of our bags apart. Then suddenly they just left, with our shit strewn all over the street. No explanation. We were all shaking. No further fun was had that night, we just got to a motel and went to bed."

Carter was at a police station twice in the days leading up to his disappearance and on both occasions he seems to have left of his own accord.\n\n> They found him not only with his head severed but with his brain removed from his skull and his spine cut out of his back.\n\n\"Severed\" and \"Cut\" are inaccurate words to be using here. His head was found separate from his body, as was his spine, but no tool-marks or other indicators of foul play could be identified during either of the two autopsies. Given that both autopsies concluded that the remains had been picked over by scavengers it is entirely likely that the body was disarticulated and scattered by animals after his death.\n\nThe skull being cut open and the brain being removed is an obvious result of the autopsies.
